## Why use the TMF?

Agencies have a number of reasons to consider the TMF as the funding source for their proposed solution:

-	**Strong Incentives.** The TMF reimagines how IT modernization projects are funded and executed. The five year repayment window provides agencies with flexibility to invest in new IT modernization projects.

-	**The Technology Modernization Board.** The interdisciplinary executive-level Board ensures projects are rigorously evaluated, best positioned for success, and take advantage of common solutions across the Federal Government.

-	**Technical Expertise.** Approved projects can leverage technical experts in design, engineering, acquisition, and cybersecurity to enhance project teams.

-	**Incremental Funding.** Iterative funding, tied to delivery of milestones, enables more agile and dynamic IT modernization funding and ensures taxpayers dollars are maximized.
